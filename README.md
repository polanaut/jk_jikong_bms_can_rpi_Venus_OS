**Connecting jikong bms JK-B1A8S10P CANBUS to raspberry pi (Venus OS)**

I am in the process of installing a leisure batter in our van. 

The idea is to have the Victron MPPT, DC-DC Charger and DIY LiFePo4 battery connected to rasperry pi with Venus OS running to allow for system monitoring via the VRM Portal.

There are some learnings that I wanted to share.

Like many others, I am confused about availability of RS485 and/or CAN on JK BMS. 

I have placed an order with AliExpress for JK-B1A8S10P - https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005007198911778.html with the assumption that BMS will support both RS485 and CAN.
