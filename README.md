**Connecting Jikong BMS JK-B1A8S10P CANBUS to Raspberry pi (Venus OS)**

# Story
I am in the process of installing a leisure batter in our van. 

The idea is to have the Victron MPPT, DC-DC Charger and DIY LiFePo4 battery connected to rasperry pi with Venus OS, to allow for system monitoring via the VRM Portal.

There are some learnings that I wanted to share.

Like many others, I am confused about availability of RS485 and/or CAN on JK BMS. 
# Order
I have placed an order with AliExpress for **JK-B1A8S10P** - https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005007198911778.html with the **assumption** that the **BMS will support both RS485 and CAN**.

Assumption was based on the item title - **jikong bms JK-B2A8S20P CANBUS 100A 200A 300A 4S 5S 6S 7S 8S 12V 24V battery with 1A 2A active balanced heating Li-ion LiFePO4 Lt**,
item description - **Gutter connection: RS485/Blue tooth** and Product Specification table below stating **"Other Interfaces (Default) - RS485"**

# BMS Arrived
Part number will indicate that I have ordered a BMS with 1A active balancer, able to cope with 100A continued current.

Due to double terminals - the BMS that has arrived, looks more like a 200A version. Not an issue but wondering why. Any ideas?
